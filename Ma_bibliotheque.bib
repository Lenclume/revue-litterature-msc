In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly speciﬁes protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 ﬁelds in a few years, increasing the complexity of the speciﬁcation while still not providing the ﬂexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconﬁgurability in the ﬁeld: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any speciﬁc network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packetprocessing functionality independently of the speciﬁcs of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to conﬁgure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the data plane has been designed with fixed functions to forward packets using a small set of protocols. This closed-design paradigm has limited the capability of the switches to proprietary implementations which are hard-coded by vendors, inducing a lengthy, costly, and inflexible process. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention from both the research community and the industry, permitting operators and programmers in general to run customized packet processing functions. This open-design paradigm is paving the way for an unprecedented wave of innovation and experimentation by reducing the time of designing, testing, and adopting new protocols; enabling a customized, top-down approach to develop network applications; providing granular visibility of packet events defined by the programmer; reducing complexity and enhancing resource utilization of the programmable switches; and drastically improving the performance of applications that are offloaded to the data plane. Despite the impressive advantages of programmable data plane switches and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides a background encompassing an overview of the evolution of networks from legacy to programmable, describing the essentials of programmable switches, and summarizing their advantages over Softwaredefined Networking (SDN) and legacy devices. The paper then presents a unique, comprehensive taxonomy of applications developed with P4 language; surveying, classifying, and analyzing more than 200 articles; discussing challenges and considerations; and presenting future perspectives and open research issues.},

	abstract = {The P4 language has drastically changed the networking field as it allows to quickly describe and implement new networking applications. Although a large variety of applications can be described with the P4 language, current programmable switch architectures impose significant constraints on P4 programs. To address this shortcoming, FPGAs have been explored as potential targets for P4 applications. P4 applications are described using three abstractions: a packet parser, match-action tables, and a packet deparser, which reassembles the output packet with the result of the match-action tables. While implementations of packet parsers and match-action tables on FPGAs have been widely covered in the literature, no general design principles have been presented for the packet deparser. Indeed, implementing a high-speed and efficient deparser on FPGAs remains an open issue because it requires a large amount of interconnections and the architecture must be tailored to a P4 program. As a result, in several works where a P4 application is implemented on FPGAs, the deparser consumes a significant proportion of chip resources. Hence, in this paper, we address this issue by presenting design principles for efficient and high-speed deparsers on FPGAs. As an artifact, we introduce a tool that generates an efficient vendor-agnostic deparser architecture from a P4 program.Our design has been validated and simulated with a cocotb-based framework.The resulting architecture is implemented on Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs and supports a throughput of more than 200 Gbps while reducing resource usage by almost 10x compared to other solutions.},

	abstract = {The emergence of P4, a domain specific language, coupled to PISA, a domain specific architecture, is revolutionizing the networking field. P4 allows to describe how packets are processed by a programmable data plane, spanning ASICs and CPUs, implementing PISA. Because the processing flexibility can be limited on ASICs, while the CPUs performance for networking tasks lag behind, recent works have proposed to implement PISA on FPGAs. However, little effort has been dedicated to analyze whether FPGAs are good candidates to implement PISA. In this work, we take a step back and evaluate the micro-architecture efficiency of various PISA blocks. We demonstrate, supported by a theoretical and experimental analysis, that the performance of a few PISA blocks is severely limited by the current FPGA architectures. Specifically, we show that match tables and programmable packet schedulers represent the main performance bottlenecks for FPGA-based programmable switches. Thus, we explore two avenues to alleviate these shortcomings. First, we identify network applications well tailored to current FPGAs. Second, to support a wider range of networking applications, we propose modifications to the FPGA architectures which can also be of interest out of the networking field.},

Packet parsers in SDN networks need to be both reconfigurable and fast, to support the evolving network protocols and the increasing multi-gigabit data rates. The combination of packet processing languages with FPGAs seems to be the perfect match for these requirements. In this work, we develop an open-source FPGA-based configurable architecture for arbitrary packet parsing to be used in SDN networks. We generate low latency and high-speed streaming packet parsers directly from a packet processing program. Our architecture is pipelined and entirely modeled using templated {\textbackslash}textttC++ classes. The pipeline layout is derived from a parser graph that corresponds to a P4 code after a series of graph transformation rounds. The RTL code is generated from the {\textbackslash}textttC++ description using Xilinx Vivado HLS and synthesized with Xilinx Vivado. Our architecture achieves a {\textbackslash}SI100 {\textbackslash}giga{\textbackslash}bit/{\textbackslash}second data rate in a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA while reducing the latency by 45\% and the LUT usage by 40\% compared to the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {A virtual local area network (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). In this context, virtual, refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic, within the local area network. VLANs work by applying tags to network frames and handling these tags in networking systems – creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.
VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs the labor of relocating nodes or rewiring data links. VLANs allow devices that must be kept separate to share the cabling of a physical network and yet be prevented from directly interacting with one another. This managed sharing yields gains in simplicity, security, traffic management, and economy. For example, a VLAN can be used to separate traffic within a business based on individual users or groups of users or their roles (e.g. network administrators), or based on traffic characteristics (e.g. low-priority traffic prevented from impinging on the rest of the network's functioning). Many Internet hosting services use VLANs to separate customers' private zones from one other, allowing each customer's servers to be grouped in a single network segment no matter where the individual servers are located in the data center. Some precautions are needed to prevent traffic "escaping" from a given VLAN, an exploit known as VLAN hopping.
To subdivide a network into VLANs, one configures network equipment. Simpler equipment might partition only each physical port (if even that), in which case each VLAN runs over a dedicated network cable. More sophisticated devices can mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Since VLANs share bandwidth, a VLAN trunk can use link aggregation, quality-of-service prioritization, or both to route data efficiently.},

	abstract = {IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that supports virtual local area networking (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. The standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling such frames. The standard also contains provisions for a quality-of-service prioritization scheme commonly known as IEEE 802.1p and defines the Generic Attribute Registration Protocol.
Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q conformant) can include VLAN tags.  When a frame enters the VLAN-aware portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN membership.  Each frame must be distinguishable as being within exactly one VLAN.  A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.
The standard was developed by IEEE 802.1, a working group of the IEEE 802 standards committee, and continues to be actively revised. One of the notable revisions is 802.1Q-2014 which incorporated IEEE 802.1aq (Shortest Path Bridging) and much of the IEEE 802.1D standard.},

	abstract = {Network security has become crucial to our society and industry. A firewall is an essential function in network operations for security enhancement. Network access control lists (ACLs) have been used to describe multi-layer security rules to determine whether a packet is passed or dropped by the firewall. An entry in ACLs contains so-called don't care bits, and consequently, ACL matching is generalized as a ternary matching problem. As ternary matching typically relies on dedicated hardware, high-performance ternary matching with commodity CPUs is challenging. We propose a practical algorithm for network ACL matching trie, named Palmtrie, that allows the multi-bit stride extension to achieve better performance. We evaluate the Palmtrie using synthetic ACLs that emulate an existing campus network and Internet backbone policies. The evaluation results demonstrate that the Palmtrie outperforms the existing ACL matching algorithms on extensive ACLs. For example, the lookup performance of the optimized Palmtrie achieves 4.76 times faster than the algorithm implemented in the widely used library (DPDK) for the scanning attack traffic on an ACL with one million entries. We also prove that the Palmtrie solves the problem with the build time of data structures in the existing algorithms.},

The main CAM-design challenge is to reduce power consumption associated with the large amount of parallel active circuitry, without sacriﬁcing speed or memory density. In this paper, we review CAM-design techniques at the circuit level and at the architectural level. At the circuit level, we review low-power matchline sensing techniques and searchline driving approaches. At the architectural level we review three methods for reducing power consumption.},

In this framework, a match-action-based hardware architecture is introduced with clearly designed components, which correspond to the described functionalities in the P4 programs. A pre-built template library is used for the compilation that includes optimized VHDL templates corresponding to specific clearly designed components. From the output of a standard frontend P4 compiler, the proposed compiler extracts parameters and relationships within the functions being employed, maps them to corresponding templates by calling, configuring, optimizing and instantiating them, and finally generates the appropriate FPGA code. A pre-built evaluation library is also proposed that helps the compiler to optimize the implementation during the mapping phase. A prototype of this framework is also implemented and evaluated; in this process, it is found that the generated processors use few resources and have high throughput and low latency. Compared with a state-of-the-art solution, the packet processing time is halved. In addition, the generated processors are able to operate at a line rate of nearly 100 Gigabits per second for a basic layer-3 forwarding application.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we show that up to hundreds of software load balancer (SLB) servers can be replaced by a single modern switching ASIC, potentially reducing the cost of load balancing by over two orders of magnitude. Today, large data centers typically employ hundreds or thousands of servers to load-balance incoming traffic over application servers. These software load balancers (SLBs) map packets destined to a service (with a virtual IP address, or VIP), to a pool of servers tasked with providing the service (with multiple direct IP addresses, or DIPs). An SLB is stateful, it must always map a connection to the same server, even if the pool of servers changes and/or if the load is spread differently across the pool. This property is called per-connection consistency or PCC. The challenge is that the load balancer must keep track of millions of connections simultaneously. Until recently, it was not possible to implement a load balancer with PCC in a merchant switching ASIC, because high-performance switching ASICs typically can not maintain per-connection states with PCC. Newer switching ASICs provide resources and primitives to enable PCC at a large scale. In this paper, we explore how to use switching ASICs to build much faster load balancers than have been built before. Our system, called SilkRoad, is defined in a 400 line P4 program and when compiled to a state-of-the-art switching ASIC, we show it can load-balance ten million connections simultaneously at line rate.},

NDP switch buffers are very shallow and when they fill the switches trim packets to headers and priority forward the headers. This gives receivers a full view of instantaneous demand from all senders, and is the basis for our novel, high-performance, multipath-aware transport protocol that can deal gracefully with massive incast events and prioritize traffic from different senders on RTT timescales. We implemented NDP in Linux hosts with DPDK, in a software switch, in a NetFPGA-based hardware switch, and in P4. We evaluate NDP's performance in our implementations and in large-scale simulations, simultaneously demonstrating support for very low-latency and high throughput.},

The goal of the work presented here is to make it easier for engineers, researchers and students to learn how to program using P4, and to build prototypes running on real hardware. Our target is the NetFPGA SUME platform, a 4 x 10 Gb/s PCIe card designed for use in universities for teaching and research. Until now, NetFPGA users have needed to learn an HDL such as Verilog or VHDL, making it off limits to many software developers and students. Therefore, we developed the P4 -{\textgreater} NetFPGA workflow, allowing developers to describe how packets are to be processed in the high-level P4 language, then compile their P4 programs to run at line rate on the NetFPGA SUME board. The P4 -{\textgreater} NetFPGA workflow is built upon the Xilinx P4-SDNet compiler and the NetFPGA SUME open source code base. In this paper, we provide an overview of the P4 programming language and describe the P4 -{\textgreater} NetFPGA workflow. We also describe how the workflow is being used by the P4 community to build research prototypes, and to teach how network systems are built by providing students with hands-on experience working with real hardware.},

Statique: on a pas besoin de réécrire tout le bitstream pour la reconfiguration, mais tout le FPGA doit être reset pendant le processus
Dynamique: plus intéressant, toute la partie non-reconfigurée du FPGA continue à fonctionner pendant qu’on reconfigure le reste.
La reconfigurabilité est permise par le design hiérarchique et modulaire: typiquement, on reconfigure une entité séparément du reste. Par exemple, un périphérique ou un coprocesseur connecté au CPU.
Avis: pas super, l’écriture part un peu dans tout les sens, passe trop de temps sur les différences entre FPGAs à granularité fine ou grossière. Pas de ligne directrice claire.

	abstract = {A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory. It is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location. It can be called an address-translation cache.  It is a part of the chip's memory-management unit (MMU). A TLB may reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between CPU cache and the main memory or between the different levels of the multi-level cache. The majority of desktop, laptop, and server processors include one or more TLBs in the memory-management hardware, and it is nearly always present in any processor that utilizes paged or segmented virtual memory.
The TLB is sometimes implemented as content-addressable memory (CAM). The CAM search key is the virtual address, and the search result is a physical address. If the requested address is present in the TLB, the CAM search yields a match quickly and the retrieved physical address can be used to access memory. This is called a TLB hit. If the requested address is not in the TLB, it is a miss, and the translation proceeds by looking up the page table in a process called a page walk. The page walk is time-consuming when compared to the processor speed, as it involves reading the contents of multiple memory locations and using them to compute the physical address. After the physical address is determined by the page walk, the virtual address to physical address mapping is entered into the TLB.  The PowerPC 604, for example, has a two-way set-associative TLB for data loads and stores. Some processors have different instruction and data address TLBs.},

We examine the fundamental reasons for the inflexibility and design a new In-situ Programmable Switch Architecture (IPSA) as a fix. We further design rP4, a P4 extension, for programming IPSA-based devices. To manifest the in-situ programming feasibility, we develop an rP4 compiler and demonstrate several use cases on both a software switch, ipbm, and an FPGA-based prototype. Our preliminary experiments and analysis show that, compared to PISA, IPSA provides higher flexibility in enabling runtime functional update with limited performance and gate-count penalty. The in-situ programming capability enabled by IPSA and rP4 opens a promising design space for programmable networks.},

	abstract = {Software Defined Networking and OpenFlow offer an elegant way to decouple network control plane from data plane. This decoupling has led to great innovation in the control plane, yet the data plane changes come at much slower pace, mainly due to the hard-wired implementation of network switches. The P4 language aims to overcome this obstacle by providing a description of a customized packet processing functionality for configurable switches. That enables a new generation of possibly heterogeneous networking hardware that can be runtime tailored for the needs of particular applications from various domains. In this paper we contribute to the idea of P4 by presenting design, analysis and experimental results of our packet parser generator. The generator converts a parse graph description of P4 to a synthetizable VHDL code suitable for FPGA implementation. Our results show that the generated circuit is able to parse 100 Gbps traffic with fairly complex protocol structure at line rate on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The approach can be used not only in switches, but also in other appliances, such as application accelerators and smart NICs. We compare the generated output to a hand-written parser to show that the price for configurability is only a slightly larger and slower circuit.},

Future switches should be able to support the new features and flexibility required for parsing and processing packets. One of the critical components of switches is the packet parser that processes the headers of the packets to be able to decide on the incoming packets. Here the data plane, and particularly packet parser in OpenFlow switches, which should have the flexibility and programmability to support the new requirements and OpenFlow multiple versions, are focused. Designed here is an architecture that unlike the static network equipments, it has the flexibility and programmability in the data plane network, especially the SDN network, and supports the parsing and processing of specific packets. To describe this architecture, a high-level P4 language is used to implement it on a reconfigurable hardware (i.e., FPGA). After automatic generating the protocol-independent Packet parser architecture on the Virtex-7, it is compiled to firmware by Xilinx SDNet, and ultimately an FPGA Platform is implemented. It has fewer consumption resources and it is more efficient in terms of throughput and processing speed in comparison with other architectures.},

Many applications and services, however, need control over a combination of devices, including end host stacks, NICs, and switches, to accomplish their goals.

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged in recent years as a new network paradigm to de-ossify communication networks. Indeed, by offering a clear separation of network concerns between the management, control, and data planes, SDN allows each of these planes to evolve independently, breaking the rigidity of traditional networks. However, while well spread in the control and management planes, this de-ossification has only recently reached the data plane with the advent of packet processing languages, e.g. P4, and novel programmable switch architectures, e.g. Protocol Independent Switch Architecture (PISA). In this work, we focus on leveraging the PISA architecture by mainly exploiting the FPGA capabilities for efficient packet processing. In this way, we address this issue at different abstraction levels: i) microarchitectural; ii) programming; and, iii) architectural.
Autre résumé:
Les réseaux définis par logiciel — en anglais Software-Defined Networking (SDN) — sont apparus ces dernières années comme un nouveau paradigme de réseau. SDN introduit une séparation entre les plans de gestion, de contrôle et de données, permettant à ceux-ci d’évoluer de manière indépendante, rompant ainsi avec la rigidité des réseaux traditionnels. En particulier, dans le plan de données, les avancées récentes ont porté sur la définition des langages de traitement de paquets, tel que P4, et sur la définition d’architectures de commutateurs programmables, par exemple la Protocol Independent Switch Architecture (PISA). Dans cette thèse, nous nous intéressons a l’architecture PISA et évaluons comment exploiter les FPGA comme plateforme de traitement efficace de paquets. Cette problématique est étudiée a trois niveaux d’abstraction : microarchitectural, programmation et architectural.},

Dans le même temps, les opérateurs et les gestionnaires de réseaux veulent des systèmes plus modulaires qui puissent s’adapter rapidement aux nouveaux protocoles, mais qui ne consomment pas plus d’énergie que les solutions actuelles. Les opérateurs et administrateurs sont donc de plus en plus intéressés par des plateformes reconfigurables telles que des FPGA. Cependant, ces plateformes nécessitent encore des experts pour être utilisées et ont des temps de développement qui peuvent être longs ce qui les rend difficiles à intégrer. De plus, les infrastructures informatiques sont des éléments de plus en plus critiques pour le fonctionnement de l’économie. La sécurité des réseaux est donc devenue un point important pour protéger ces infrastructures. Actuellement la protection des réseaux est effectuée en utilisant des Systèmes de Détection d’Intrusions — Intrusion Detection System (IDS) qui effectuent l’inspection en profondeur de paquets — Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Pour permettre la protection, les IDS comparent le contenu des paquets transitant sur le réseau à des règles prédéterminées. Ces règles sont représentées soit par des chaînes de caractères ou bien des expressions régulières. Dans ce mémoire, nous proposons trois contributions en rapport à l’utilisation de FPGA pour effectuer de la recherche de texte et d’expressions régulières dans les réseaux. Ces trois réalisations sont implémentées sur des FPGA et respectent les contraintes de latence liées aux réseaux.

Autre résumé:
The next generation of mobile networks, called 5G, is expected to achieve significantly better performance than present networks : latency 10x smaller, throughput 100x higher with 100x more connected devices over the so-called 4G. Moreover, service providers and network administrators will need more configurable systems able to rapidly support new protocols. Furthermore, the power consumption of the resulting network infrastructure remains a critical consideration. A possible solution to meet all those requirements involves the use of FPGAs. However, the development complexity causes integration difficulties. In addition, computers and data-centers are more and more critical systems. Consequently, security is an important issue. This motivates introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). IDSs compare the network flow against a set of rules that are expressed with strings and regular expressions. This thesis proposes three contributions in regard to FPGAs utilization for text and regular expression search. Those contributions respect the latency constraint of networks and are implemented into FPGAs.},

	abstract = {Les réseaux prédiﬀusés programmables — en anglais Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)— sont omniprésents dans les centres de données, pour accélérer des tâches d’indexations et d’apprentissage machine, mais aussi plus récemment, pour accélérer des opérations réseaux. Dans cette thèse, nous nous intéressons à l’opération de recherche du plus long préﬁxe en anglais Longest Preﬁx Match (LPM) — sur FPGA. Cette opération est utilisée soit pour router des paquets, soit comme un bloc de base dans un plan de données programmable. Bien que l’opération LPM soit primordiale dans un réseau, celle-ci souﬀre d’ineﬃcacité sur FPGA. Dans cette thèse, nous démontrons que la performance de l’opération LPM sur FPGA peut être substantiellement améliorée en utilisant une approche algorithmique, où l’opération LPM est implémentée à l’aide d’une structure de données. Par ailleurs, les résultats présentés permettent de réﬂéchir à une question plus large : est-ce que l’architecture des FPGA devrait être spécialisée pour les applications réseaux ? Premièrement, pour l’application de routage IPv6 dans le réseau Internet, nous présentons SHIP. Cette solution exploite les caractéristiques des préﬁxes pour construire une structure de données compacte, pouvant être implémentée de manière eﬃcace sur FPGA. SHIP utilise l’approche ńdiviser pour régnerż pour séparer les préﬁxes en groupes de faible cardinalité et ayant des caractéristiques similaires. Les préﬁxes contenus dans chaque groupe sont en-suite encodés dans une structure de données hybride, où l’encodage des préﬁxes est adapté suivant leurs caractéristiques. Sur FPGA, SHIP augmente l’eﬃcacité de l’opération LPM comparativement à l’état de l’art, tout en supportant un débit supérieur à 100 Gb/s. Deuxièment, nous présentons comment implémenter eﬃcacement l’opération LPM pour un plan de données programmable sur FPGA. Dans ce cas, contrairement au routage de pa-quets, aucune connaissance à priori des préﬁxes ne peut être utilisée. Par conséquent, nous présentons un cadre de travail comprenant une structure de données eﬃcace, indépendam-ment des caractéristiques des préﬁxes contenus, et des méthodes permettant d’implémenter eﬃcacement la structure de données sur FPGA. Un arbre B, étendu pour l’opération LPM, est utilisé en raison de sa faible complexité algorithmique. Nous présentons une méthode pour allouer à la compilation le minimum de ressources requis par l’abre B pour encoder un ensemble de préﬁxes, indépendamment de leurs caractéristiques. Plusieurs méthodes sont ensuite présentées pour augmenter l’eﬃcacité mémoire après implémentation de la structure de données sur FPGA. Évaluée sur plusieurs scénarios, cette solution est capable de traiter plus de 100 Gb/s, tout en améliorant la performance par rapport à l’état de l’art.
Autre résumé:
FPGAs are becoming ubiquitous in data centers. First introduced to accelerate indexing services and machine learning tasks, FPGAs are now also used to accelerate networking operations, including the LPM operation. This operation is used for packet routing and as a building block in programmable data planes. However, for the two uses cases considered, the LPM operation is ineﬃciently implemented in FPGAs. In this thesis, we demonstrate that the performance of LPM operation can be signiﬁcantly improved using an algorithmic approach, where the LPM operation is implemented using a data structure. In addition, using the results presented in this thesis, we can answer a broader question: Should the FPGA architecture be specialized for networking? First, we present the SHIP data structure that is tailored to routing IPv6 packets in the Internet network. SHIP exploits the preﬁx characteristics to build a compact data structure that can be eﬃciently mapped to FPGAs. First, SHIP uses a "divide and conquer" approach to bin preﬁxes in groups with a small cardinality and sharing similar characteristics. Second, a hybrid-trie-tree data structure is used to encode the preﬁxes held in each group. The hybrid data structure adapts the preﬁx encoding method to their characteristics. Then, we demonstrated that SHIP can be eﬃciently implemented in FPGAs. Implemented on FPGAs, the proposed solution improves the memory eﬃciency over the state of the art solutions, while supporting a packet throughput greater than 100 Gbps.While the preﬁxes and their characteristics are known when routing packets in the Internet network, this is not true for programmable data planes. Hence, the second solution, designed for programmable data planes, does not exploit any prior knowledge of the preﬁx stored. We present a framework comprising an eﬃcient data structure to encode the preﬁxes and methods to map the data structure eﬃciently to FPGAs. First, the framework leverages a B-tree, extended to support the LPM operation, for its low algorithmic complexity. Second, we present a method to allocate at compile time the minimum amount of resources that can be used by the B-tree. Third, our framework selects the B-tree parameters to increase the post-implementation memory eﬃciency and generates the corresponding hardware architecture. Implemented on FPGAs, this solution supports packet throughput greater than 100 Gbps, while improving the performance over the state of the art.},

We study two classes of messages that a CV can transmit: 1) messages containing information about the transmitter only [e.g., standardized basic safety messages (BSMs) and cooperative awareness messages (CAMs)], and 2) messages that aggregate information about the transmitter and surrounding objects detected by their onboard sensors [e.g., collective perception messages (CPMs)]. We show how the proposed framework allows one to identify safety-critical vehicles and the effect of the type of transmitted messages on the awareness of these critical vehicles. To evaluate the performance, we use experimental data with mixed traffic of unconnected vehicles and CVs at different penetration ratios. Results show that CPMs are significantly more effective at providing awareness of safety-critical vehicles at low-to-mid-connectivity penetrations. At high-connectivity penetrations, messages with only information about the transmitter are sufficient to provide full awareness without burdening the wireless channel.},

One of the most critical issues in the development of autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems is their poor performance under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, fog, and hail. However, no current study provides a systematic and unified review of the effect that weather has on the various types of sensors used in autonomous vehicles. In this article, we first present a literature review about the impact of adverse weather conditions on state-ofthe-art sensors, such as lidar, GPS, camera, and radar. Then, we characterize the effect of rainfall on millimeter-wave (mmwave) radar, which considers both the rain attenuation and the backscatter effects. Our simulation results show that the detection range of mm-wave radar can be reduced by up to 45\% under severe rainfall conditions. Moreover, the rain backscatter effect is significantly different for targets with different radar cross-section (RCS) areas.},

In the following we propose models to realistically simulate the effects of rain, snow, and fog on LiDAR datasets based on physical and empirical fundamentals.

This methodology is based on a framework that simultaneously exploits the strengths of each individual network by using a set of decision rules. The implementation begins with a manual approach in which a typical, hierarchical decision tree characterizes the decision process of a single application when sending data to other users in the network. Analytical and simulation results validate the decision system approach when diversity is exploited as demonstrated by a boost in application performance, achieving an average latency under 100 ms and a 40\% increase in throughput due to the increased packet delivery ratio. We then apply an ensemble learning technique, Random Forests (RF), to automatically reproduce the performance of the manually built tree system. Simulations under realistic traffic scenarios show the RF approach can replicate manually-built tree performance with up to 98\% precision. A comparison with another state-of-the-art hybrid method also shows the RF scheme improves performance under a different application scenario without additional manual adjustments. With our methodology, we can add different application requirements and network characteristics to obtain a fully automated and adaptable decision system to optimize vehicular safety applications.},

	abstract = {Software-defined Networking (SDN) introduced the decoupling of control and data forwarding planes. Despite advances in the programmability of SDNs, there remains a strong need for a fully programmable packet scheduler in the data plane. In this context, the ability to adapt to various traffic patterns and the expressiveness of schedulers are of paramount importance. This paper introduces the Dynamic Ranking Push-In-First-Out (DR-PIFO), as an algorithmic model that can be used to develop programmable packet schedulers based on PIFO queues. The DR-PIFO is a highly expressive model, capable of expressing a wide range of work-conserving, non-work-conserving, and hierarchical scheduling algorithms. Additionally, its dynamic ranking capabilities allow for real-time updates to the packet’s priority within the scheduler. The proposed solution also performs error detection in the departure order of packets, which is essential to avoid starvation in strict priority scheduling. These features are crucial when implementing popular scheduling algorithms such as the pFabric. The DR-PIFO is evaluated through its algorithmic properties and by implementing two distinct case studies. Its performance is further evaluated by incorporating it as an external module, written in a high-level language, and integrating it with software switches implemented using the P4 language. The results illustrate the superior expressiveness of DR-PIFO over state-of-the-art models such as PIFO and PIEO and confirm that it is an algorithm-agnostic model. Thus, DRPIFO represents a promising solution for implementing more fully programmable packet schedulers in SDNs, with the potential to improve performance and adaptability.},

	abstract = {Low latency is a requirement for a variety of interactive network applications. The Internet, however, is not optimized for latency. We thus explore the design of wide-area networks that move data at nearly the speed of light in vacuum. Our cISP design augments the Internet's fiber with free-space microwave wireless connectivity over paths very close to great-circle paths. cISP addresses the fundamental challenge of simultaneously providing ultra-low latency while accounting for numerous practical factors ranging from transmission tower availability to packet queuing. We show that instantiations of cISP across the United States and Europe would achieve mean latencies within 5\% of that achievable using great-circle paths at the speed of light, over medium and long distances. Further, using experiments conducted on a nearly-speed-of-light algorithmic trading network, together with an analysis of trading data at its end points, we show that microwave networks are reliably faster than fiber networks even in inclement weather. Finally, we estimate that the economic value of such networks would substantially exceed their expense},

	abstract = {In-situ programmability refers to the capability for network devices to update data plane functions and protocol processing logic at runtime without interrupting the services, driven by dynamic and interactive network operations towards autonomous networks. The existing programmable switch architecture (e.g., PISA) and programming language (e.g., P4) were designed for monolithic and static implementation, which requires a complete programming and deployment cycle for functional update, incurring long delay and service interruption. Addressing the fundamental reasons for such inﬂexibility, we design a new In-situ Programmable Switch Architecture (IPSA) and the corresponding design ﬂow using rP4, a P4 language extension, as a ﬁx. The compiler contains algorithms to support efﬁcient resource mapping for both base design and incremental updates. To manifest the in-situ programming feasibility, we demonstrate several practical use cases on both a software switch, ipbm, and an FPGA-based prototype. Our experiments and analysis show that IPSA incurs moderate hardware cost which can be justiﬁed by its beneﬁts and compensated by newer chip technologies. The in-situ programmability enabled by IPSA and rP4 advances the state of the art of programmable networks and opens a promising new design space.},

	abstract = {The basic function of the Internet is to delivery data (what) to serve the needs of all applications. IP names the attachment points (where) to facilitate ubiquitous interconnectivity as the current way to deliver data. The fundamental mismatch between data delivery and naming attachment points leads to a lot of challenges, e.g., mapping from data name to IP address, handling dynamics of underlying topology, scaling up the data distribution, and securing communication, etc. Information-centric networking (ICN) is proposed to shift the focus of communication paradigm from where to what, by making the named data the first-class citizen in the network, The basic consensus of ICN is to name the data independent from its container (space dimension) and session (time dimension), which breaks the limitation of point-to-point IP semantic. It scales up data distribution by utilizing available resources, and facilitates communication to fit diverse connectivity and heterogeneous networks. However, there are only a few consensuses on the detailed design of ICN, and quite a few different ICN architectures are proposed. This paper reveals the rationales of ICN from the perspective of the Internet evolution, surveys different design choices, and discusses on two debatable topics in ICN, i.e., self-certifying versus hierarchical names, and edge versus pervasive caching. We hope this survey helps clarify some mis-understandings on ICN and achieve more consensuses.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCC54389.2021.9674259},
	abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) separates the data plane and the control plane in the traditional network, and the data plane communicates with the control plane through standard protocols. With the development of SDN, there are many southbound communication protocols in academia, such as OpenFlow, Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF), Programming protocol-independent packet processors (P4). The design ideas and implementation of these protocols are very different. Therefore, many controllers provide some high-level Application Programming Interfaces (API) supporting different protocols to shield the complexity of the protocol and facilitate the writing of network strategies, but none of them can support different southbound protocols at the runtime. That is, the controller can’t support a variety of different protocols while the data plane has kinds of switches. For example, Open Network Operating System (ONOS) supports P4 and OpenFlow, but it can only support a specific data plane at the runtime, so it cannot combine the strengths and advantages of different types of programmable switches. This paper proposes a unified programming model that can support both the P4 and POF protocols at the runtime so that network users can combine the high performance of the P4 and the flexibility of the POF. We also provide kinds of API to facilitate the writing of network strategies. In certain application scenarios, the losing of data packets caused by updating the data plane pipeline can be effectively eliminated with the programming model.},

	abstract = {The P4 community has recently put significant effort to increase the diversity of targets on which P4 programs can be implemented. These include fixed function and programmable ASICs, FPGAs, NICs, and CPUs. However, P4 programs are written according to the set of functionalities supported by the target for which they are compiled. For instance, a P4 program targeting a programmable ASIC cannot be extended with user-defined processing modules, which limits the flexibility and the abstraction of P4 programs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a heterogeneous P4 programmable data plane comprised of different targets that together appear as a single logical unit. The proposed data plane broadens the range of functionalities available to P4 programmers by combining the strength of each target. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed P4 data plane by coupling an FPGA with a soft switch which emulates a programmable ASIC. The proposed data plane is demonstrated with the implementation of a simplified L2 switch. The emulated ASIC match-table capacity is extended by the FPGA by an order of magnitude.The FPGA also integrates a proprietary module using a P4 extern.},
